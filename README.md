## Hello 👋

Welcome to my Github! I'm Max, a full-stack software engineer looking to make my breakthrough into tech. I recently transitioned out of a career in medicine for reasons I'd love to talk about at length with anyone that is interested. I've been enjoying build many different types of applications, so I wanted to make a small list of the ones I am most proud of.

## Projects 💻

**Friender** 🤝
* Developed the back end as a JSON returning RESTful API using Express.js
* Implemented authentication and authorization leveraging JWTs and middleware
* Handled database communication and management utilizing classes and raw SQL queries
* Created a dynamic, single-page application for the front end, utilizing React to deliver an efficient, responsive UI with seamless state management, modular components, and optimized performance due to its use of a virtual DOM and powerful reconciliation algorithms
* Implemented location-based filtering by leveraging the ZipCode API, allowing users to view potential friends within a set geographical distance from them
* Integrated real-time chat features for matched users using websockets
* Deployed site can be found [here](https://friender-mj.surge.sh)

**RCTracker** ☕ 🍽️
* Built the backend using Flask and employed Flask templating with Jinja to dynamically render HTML, simplifying the development workflow and seamlessly integrating server-side logic with front-end presentation
* Utilized Flask SQLAlchemy for robust database management, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval of user-submitted venues
* Integrated WTForms to create and validate user input forms, enhancing data accuracy and the user experience
* Leveraged the Mapquest API to generate interactive maps for displaying the locations of cafes and restaurants, providing users with visual navigation
* Deployed site can be found [here](https://rctracker.onrender.com)
